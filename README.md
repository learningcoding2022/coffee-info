## Overview

This project was to build a site using one one of the provided public APIs.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Access two different sets of coffee data
- Navigate to specific pages containing this data and navigate back to the home page.

### Links

- Solution URL: https://learningcoding2022.github.io/news-homepage/

## My process

I coded this project with a mobile first approach. This project uses css, html, and javascript to provide a website with 3 separate pages. The home page provides general information while the hot coffee and iced coffee pages house the corresponding api data.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project increased my confidence in calling apis and then displaying them on a webpage using a list format. It also refreshed my memory in creating and linking multiple pages within a home page.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to utilize api data and incorporate it into my project in news ways, increasing my knowledge and confidence in the areas of apis and javascript.
